# HIDExplorer
Macintosh utility for displaying the internal API of USB devices

This is a port to Cocoa of an ancient Apple example of probing the USB device tree to see the individual elements of a USB device. Select your device and element, then click the button or otherwise move the control, and you'll see the U.I. update to show you the changed values.

On my mouse, button:

0x05 - left button.

0x06 - right button.

0x07 - center button.

0x08 - rear thumb button.

0x09 - front thumb button

other buttons not connected. (the scrollwheel feels like it has additional buttons but they don't seem to work.)
calibrated versus raw (or scaled) not done.
